# csv_tutoringmatchingsystem

Created for the [Cambridge School Volunteers](csvinc.org)' tutoring service. This system connects high school students with tutors in their desired subjects and available times.

## Overview of Process

*(Proccesses in italics are automated)*

1. Students and tutors will fill out a [sign-up form](https://tinyurl.com/csvtutor); *their information is logged in a spreadsheet*
2. *A script generates all possible matches of tutors and students*
3. Administrators select matches by selecting from a form listing all possible matches
4. *this will then update a master database, which then can have data taken from later*
