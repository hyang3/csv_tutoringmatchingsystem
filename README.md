# csv_tutoringmatchingsystem

## Overview of Process

(italics is backend and done programatically, users like students/tutors/person making matches won't have to interact with them at all)

1. students + tutors will fill out a form, *to which all their information will be loaded into a spreadsheet*
2. *this will then automatically call a filter which will list all possible tutors and students, which will then be funneled into a form*
3. person making matches will then make matches by selecting from that form (which will be automatically generated) of possible combinations of students to tutors
4. *this will then update a master database, which then can have data taken from later*

## How to Use

*todo* but basically install packages (or set up your venv), set configs, set up your credentials.json, and run the makefile
